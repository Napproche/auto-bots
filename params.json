{"name":"Auto-bots","tagline":"A collection of scripts and small bots to automate various tasks.","body":"# Auto-bots\r\n\r\nA mishmash of various scripts and bots that make life easier. Most of these scripts are `bash` scripts, but some are written in ```python``` or ```MATLAB```\r\n\r\nAll files here are either ```script```s or ```bot```s. ```script```s are meant to be run manually, as you need them. ```bot```s are meant to run in the background using a system-level scheduler like ```crontab```\r\n\r\n# installation\r\n\r\nIf you have git installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sg-s/auto-bots.git\r\ncd auto-bots\r\nchmod a+x link-scripts.sh\r\n./link-scripts.sh\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Contents\r\n\r\n## link-scripts\r\n\r\nWhat's the use of having a bunch of scripts if you need to remember where they are and have to manually set permissions for them to get them working? link-scripts automatically makes all the scripts in the current folder executable, and links them using short names (it strips out the extension) to a folder in /usr/bin/.\r\n\r\nSo once you run the install script above, you can run any of the scripts from anywhere in your computer using (for example)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake-retina\r\n```\r\n\r\n## copy-fonts ```[script]```\r\n\r\nMoving computers? Take your fonts with you. Copies fonts from commonly used folders on Mac OS X into a folder called \"fonts\" in your home folder so you can move it easily.\r\n\r\n## keep-process-running ```[bot]```\r\n\r\nkeep-process-running is meant to be run continuously, e.g., using crontab. \r\n\r\nedit the file (e.g., on line 3) with the process you want to keep running: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nif [ $(ps aux | grep \"Quicksilver\" | wc -l) -eq 1 ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## netup.m ```[bot]```\r\n\r\n## keep-stf-mounted ```[bot]```\r\n\r\n## strip-mp3 ```[script]```\r\n\r\n## where-am-i.py ```[bot]```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
